12. Do we proceed to international transfer of data?
When choosing service providers, Glovo may transfer your data outside the borders of the European Economic Area, for example to the United States. In such cases, Glovo will ensure before sending the data, that such service providers are in compliance with the standard clauses and minimum security standards established by the European Commission and that they always process the data in accordance with Glovo’s instructions. 

Basis and instructions regarding the international transfer

Glovo may have a contractual relationship with service providers under which they agree to comply with Glovo’s instructions and put in place the necessary security measures to protect your data.

Where Glovo is compelled to carry out further processing by EU law or the law of the EU Member States to which it is subject, it shall inform the service provider of such legal requirements prior to the processing. 

Glovo may subsequently change, supplement or replace the instructions initially given to the service provider by means of individual instructions and is entitled to issue appropriate instructions at any time. This includes, among other things, instructions regarding the correction, deletion and prohibition of data. All instructions issued shall be documented by both Glovo and the service provider. 

Requirements directed to service providersService providers may only collect, process or use data pursuant to a master contract and in accordance with Glovo’s instructions. This applies in particular to the transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organizations.

External service providers are required to inform Glovo if they consider that an instruction issued by Glovo, is in contravention of the data protection legislation. Furthermore, service providers are entitled to suspend the execution of the instruction concerned until its confirmation or modification by Glovo, and they have a duty to refuse to carry out any instructions that are clearly illegal.

13. Do we proceed to automated decision making? 
Glovo does not adopt any decision that could affect our User/ Courier / Job Applicant significantly based solely on automated processing of their data (e.g. reordering from the stores where our Users have ordered in the past). The only decision-making processes of Glovo are conducted by applying human intervention (e.g. defining the conditions that the User shall meet to be considered for an offer, such as location). 

Regarding the existence of automated decisions with legal effects for the Courier, it should be noted that:

Decisions are not made solely on the basis of the automated processing of the personal data of Couriers, but, where appropriate, on the basis of an assessment of the performance of the service.
Consumers or Stores have generated all parameters to be taken into account manually. 
All parameters and metrics used to make such decisions always and exclusively refer to the service and the execution of the Terms and Conditions, regardless of the Courier executing it.
Profiles based on the personal data or personal characteristics of the Couriers are not created, as described below.
In no case the attributes of the personality or of the non-professional sphere of the Couriers are taken into account.
The results depend on previous and voluntary actions of the Couriers.
The results may be corrected if there has been an error and/or discrepancy between the Couriers and Glovo.
The Couriers are not prevented from exercising any right. 
The Couriers are not prevented from accessing a good or service.
The Couriers are not prevented from entering into a contract. 
14. Do we proceed to profile creations?

When using the application, Glovo classifies Users based on the information provided by them about their usage of the application to adapt it to their needs and to improve it. 

The classification is conducted by solely using first party data. We use information that our Users provide us, such as their historical orders and popularity among new users to suggest similar stores that could be of their interest. This classification is only intended to ensure that our Users find relevant contents, Partners or offers, among others, that may be suitable according to their preferences, and will never have any legal effect on them or the provision of the services by Glovo, the Partners or the Couriers.

15. What security measures have been adopted?
Glovo has taken the necessary steps recommended by the European Commission and the competent authority to maintain the required security level, according to the nature of the personal data processed and the circumstances of the processing, in order to avoid, to the extent possible and always in accordance with the state of the art, its alteration, loss or unauthorised access or processing. As mentioned above, the personal data supplied will not be disclosed to third parties without the data subject’s prior authorisation.
