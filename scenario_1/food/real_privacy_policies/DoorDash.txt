How to Manage Cookies – You may disable the use of cookies by modifying your browser settings. If you choose to disable
cookies you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our Services. For more information on cookies and

B. Web Beacons
Web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs, are tiny graphics with a unique identi"er that may be included on
our platforms to deliver or communicate with cookies, in order to track and measure the performance of our platforms and
Services, monitor how many web visitors we have, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are
stored on the user’s hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on webpages (or in an email).
C. Online Analytics and Advertising Technologies
We and our third-party vendors may use automated technologies (including cookie identi"ers on our platforms), along with
other collected information, to tailor ads or deliver content when you are on our Services or on other devices, apps or websites.

D. Targeted Advertising
We (or our service providers) may use the information we collect, for instance, IP addresses and unique mobile device
identi"ers, to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or
computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless

experience across devices. If you wish to opt out of such cross device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you
may do so through your device settings. We may also use cross-device tracking to help identify our users and serve advertising.
This type of advertising is often called “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising and when it occurs on mobile apps, “crossapp” advertising.
You can learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising by visiting (i) the
Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) or (ii) the Digital
Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). To opt out of Google Analytics for display
advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page (https://www.google.com
/settings/ads). These links are provided for convenience purposes only; DoorDash is not responsible or liable for the compliance
practices and programs of the companies managing the opt-out processes available through the above links.
E. Mobile Applications
Depending on your permissions, we may receive your personal information from your Internet service and mobile device
providers. Users of mobile devices who do not want to receive interest-based advertising may opt-out in several ways. Learn
more about your choices for mobile devices by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices (http://www.aboutads.info
/appchoices). Each operating system, (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, etc.) provides its own instructions on
how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You should view your device or system settings to
determine how you can opt out of use of your device ID for “cross-app” personalized advertising.
4. Security.
DoorDash has implemented administrative, organizational, technical, and physical security controls that are designed to
safeguard personal information. However, no online activity is ever fully secure or error-free. While we strive to protect your
information, we cannot guarantee that your personal information is absolutely secure. Please keep this in mind when disclosing
any information to DoorDash.
Please recognize that protecting your personal information is also your responsibility. We urge you to take every precaution to
protect your information when you are on the Internet, or when you communicate with us and with others through the Internet.
Change your passwords as appropriate, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. If
you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your
account might have been compromised), or if you suspect someone else is using your account, please let us know immediately
by contacting us as indicated in Section 12 (Contact Us) of this Policy.
5. Data Retention.
Our retention of your personal information may vary based upon the nature of our relationship with you (e.g., User, Non-Dasher
Independent Contractor, etc.) or, as applicable, the company or business with whom you are employed, associated, or
connected (e.g., in the case of Merchant Personnel and Service Provider Personnel, etc.) and based upon several factors,
including without limitation, the following:

• The length of time necessary to ful"ll the purpose(s) for which we collected the personal information;
• When your relationship with us ceases or terminates or when the company or business that you are affiliated,
associated, or connected with, ceases to maintain a business relationship with us;

• The length of time it is reasonable to keep records to demonstrate that we have ful"lled our business and legal duties and obligations and contractual commitments (as applicable);

• Any limitation periods within which claims can be made;
• Any retention periods prescribed by law or recommended by regulators, professional bodies, or associations;
and

• The existence of any relevant legal proceedings.

6. Third-Party Sites.
Some of the functionality may be provided by third parties and the Services may link to other third-party websites that are not
controlled by DoorDash. These third parties are not under our control and DoorDash is not responsible for their privacy policies
or practices. If you provide any personal information to any third party or through any such third-party website, we recommend
that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of that third party.

7. Children’s Information.
A. Our Services are not intended for children under 16 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 16 and believe he or she has disclosed
personal information to us, please contact us at privacy@doordash.com (mailto:privacy@doordash.com). A parent or guardian
of a child under age 16 may review and request deletion of the child’s personal information. Parents or guardian’s should closely
monitor their User accounts to ensure that the accounts are properly used.
B. In connection with our business-to-business relationships, we do not knowingly process any personal information of or about
a child.
C. If we become aware that personal information we collected is associated with a minor under 16 years of age, we will delete
that personal information.
8. Your Rights and Choices.
A. Your Rights.
You may have rights under certain data protection and privacy laws pertaining to our processing of your personal information.
These rights are not absolute, meaning that, as permitted under applicable data protection and privacy laws, we may not be
obligated to comply with your request and we can limit the frequency of your requests. For all requests, we will need to verify the
identity of the data subject and, if applicable, the identity and authority of the person submitting the request on behalf of the
data subject. If we are unable to con"rm or validate the identity of the data subject and, if applicable, the identity and authority
of the requestor if different than the data subject, then we may reject or deny the request. Subject to applicable data protection

IP
addresses

add to a profile about your

profiles may enable delivery
of interest-based advertising
or cross-context behavioral
advertising by such third
parties within their platform or
on other sites.
