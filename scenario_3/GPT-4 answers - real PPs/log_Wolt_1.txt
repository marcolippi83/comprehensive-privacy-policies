Q1: Wolt processes two general categories of data about you: User Data and Usage Data. User Data is collected directly from you or from the customer organization on behalf of which you are using Wolt Services. This includes your full name, email address, telephone number, information relating to your payment instruments (not stored by Wolt), a picture, delivery address, location data, partner-specific bonus card or loyalty program details, age (for age-restricted goods), and any other information you provide while creating or modifying your account. Usage Data arises from your interactions with Wolt Services and includes information that describes your device, network connection, IP address, country, interactions with Wolt Services, and data for tracking transactions initiated by advertising partners.

Q2: Wolt uses your email address for purposes such as offering Wolt Services, managing and delivering your Order and communicating with you about changes to terms and conditions or other important changes. It helps them to perform contractual obligations, manage customer relationships, or comply with legal obligations.

Q3: Wolt shares geolocation data (if you consent to the processing of your geolocation data) primarily with third parties such as Partners involved in the preparation, sale, and/or delivery of your order. It is shared to allow for the performance of services, such as to communicate with you for order-related clarifications or to ensure delivery of your orders, and possibly with authorized service providers performing services for Wolt, including data analytics. The specific third parties with whom the geolocation data is shared are not directly mentioned in the statement.

Q4: Data processed on the basis of consent might include additional User Data you give voluntarily, such as location data, marketing opt-ins and opt-outs, and potentially other information you provide while using Wolt Services. Wolt may ask for separate consent to process data that may imply a health condition or other sensitive personal data, such as medical prescription data in the case of prescription medicine. If required, Wolt will ask for separate consent for processing such personal data, and consent may be withdrawn at any time through profile settings or contacting Wolt support.

Q5: If you connect or login to your account with Facebook, Facebook shares your profile picture, a sample of your Facebook friends, and your Facebook ID with Wolt. Wolt and Facebook are joint controllers of your personal data processed through Facebook.

Q6: The document does not specifically mention data sharing with insurers. Therefore, based on the provided information, Wolt does not share your data with insurers.

Q7: The categories of data Wolt collects about you automatically include Usage Data such as information about your device or browser, IP address, identifiers provided by your device or third parties, country, locale, time zone, source link of Wolt Services, interaction with campaigns, advertisements, orders, and analytics data provided by third-party services integrated into Wolt's systems.

Q8: To contact Wolt if you wish to exercise your rights, you can reach out to Wolt's support team, send a letter, or an email to the addresses set out in the statement. The Data Protection Officer can be reached at privacy@wolt.com. If you have a Wolt account, it is recommended to contact them through Wolt support for easier identification.

Q9: The document does not provide a specific timeframe for how long Wolt keeps your delivery address after you have deleted your account. However, it mentions that personal data may be stored as long as it is required by law or is reasonably necessary for legal obligations or legitimate interests such as claims handling or internal reporting. Regular assessments are made to ensure data is stored only for the necessary time period.
